## Innovative Idea
Our idea is to create a website called Spotify Wheel that’s main purpose is to allow users to log in with their Spotify account and manage their playlists by easily finding new music from new playlists, moving songs between playlists, removing songs from playlists, and connect with other users by being able to comment on songs and have friends in the application – which will notify the user when their friend makes a comment on a song. There will also be a bookmark feature to help users remember where they were last listening to if they got sidetracked listening to a particular playlist.

## Important Components
The most core components would be: log in with a spotify account, be able to take in all of the user’s created playlists, be able to take the currently playing song and move, copy, like, or delete it from the currently playing playlist. Be able to post a comment on any song, and have this comment viewed by any other user of the website if they listen to this song. Comments can have likes on them, and the creator of a comment will get a notification if someone liked their comment. There will also be the ability to add friends in the website, which will notify you if any of your friends makes a comment on a song.
